Basic programming language interpreter in JavaScript.  
Provides basic programming language functionality such as variables and functions through easy-to-use keywords and labels, within a highly extensible context.  

Extensive configuration on the interpreter allows most aspects of execution to be controlled within the host program.  

Allows (optional) interface with the main program outside of extensions, using `import` and `export`.
