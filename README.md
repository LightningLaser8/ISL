## ISL: Integrate Scripting Language

Basic programming language interpreter in JavaScript, designed as a way to perform more complex operations with the mod loader [Integrate](https://github.com/LightningLaser8/Integrate).  

Provides basic programming language functionality such as variables and functions through easy-to-use keywords and labels, within a highly extensible context, allowing this to be used in any complying program, not just Integrate-compatible ones.  

Extensive configuration on the interpreter allows most aspects of execution to be controlled within the host program.
